CONCEPT: 
- Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. OOP is a method of software development that has its own practices, concepts, and vocabulary.

There are primarily two methods of programming in use today: procedural and object-oriented. The earliest programming languages were procedural, meaning a program was made of one or more procedures. A procedure is a set of programming statements that, together, perform a specific task. The statements might gather input from the user, manipulate data stored in the computer’s memory, and perform calculations or any other operation necessary to complete the procedure’s task.

Procedures typically operate on data items that are separate from the procedures. In a procedural program, the data items are commonly passed from one procedure to another, as shown in Figure 1-9.

As you might imagine, the focus of procedural programming is on the creation of procedures that operate on the program’s data. The separation of data and the code that operates on the data often leads to problems, however. For example, the data is stored in a particular format, which consists of variables and more complex structures that are created from variables. The procedures that operate on the data must be designed with that format in mind. But, what happens if the format of the data is altered? Quite often, a program’s specifications change, resulting in a redesigned data format. When the structure of the data changes, the code that operates on the data must also be changed to accept the new format. This results in added work for programmers and a greater opportunity for bugs to appear in the code.


This has helped influence the shift from procedural programming to object-oriented programming (OOP). Whereas procedural programming is centered on creating procedures, object-oriented programming is centered on creating objects. An object is a software entity that contains data and procedures. The data contained in an object is known as the object’s attributes. The procedures, or behaviors, that an object performs are known as the object’s methods. The object is, conceptually, a self-contained unit consisting of data (attributes) and procedures (methods). This is illustrated in Figure 1-10.

OOP addresses the problem of code/data separation through encapsulation and data hiding. Encapsulation refers to the combining of data and code into a single object. Data hiding refers to an object’s ability to hide its data from code that is outside the object. Only the object’s methods may then directly access and make changes to the object’s data. An object typically hides its data, but allows outside code to access the methods that operate on the data. As shown in Figure 1-11, the object’s methods provide programming statements outside the object with indirect access to the object’s data.

Code outside the object interacts with the object’s methods

When an object’s internal data is hidden from outside code and access to that data is restricted to the object’s methods, the data is protected from accidental corruption. In addition, the programming code outside the object does not need to know about the format or internal structure of the object’s data. The code only needs to interact with the object’s methods. When a programmer changes the structure of an object’s internal data, he or she also modifies the object’s methods so they may properly operate on the data. The way in which outside code interacts with the methods, however, does not change.

These are just a few of the benefits of object-oriented programming. Because Java is fully object-oriented, you will learn much more about OOP practices, concepts, and terms as you progress through this book.
