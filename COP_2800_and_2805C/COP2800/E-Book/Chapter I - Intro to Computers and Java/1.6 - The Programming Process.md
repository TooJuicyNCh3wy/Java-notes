**CONCEPT**: 
- The programming process consists of several steps, which include design, creation, testing, and debugging activities.

Now that you have been introduced to what a program is, it’s time to consider the process of creating a program. Quite often when inexperienced students are given programming assignments, they have trouble getting started because they don’t know what to do first. If you find yourself in this dilemma, the following steps may help.

  1. Clearly define what the program is to do.
  2. Visualize the program running on the computer.
  3. Use design tools to create a model of the program.
  4. Check the model for logical errors.
  5. Enter the code and compile it.
  6. Correct any errors found during compilation. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 as many times as necessary.
  7. Run the program with test data for input.
  8. Correct any runtime errors found while running the program. Repeat Steps 5 through 8 as many times as necessary.
  9. Validate the results of the program.

These steps emphasize the importance of planning. Just as there are good ways and bad ways to paint a house, there are good ways and bad ways to create a program. A good program always begins with planning. With the pay-calculating algorithm that was presented earlier in this chapter serving as our example, let’s look at each of the steps in more detail.

Clearly define what the program is to do
===========================================

This step commonly requires you to identify the purpose of the program, the data that is to be input, the processing that is to take place, and the desired output. Let’s examine each of these requirements for the pay-calculating algorithm.

```
Purpose  To calculate the user’s gross pay.

Input    Number of hours worked, hourly pay rate.

Process  Multiply number of hours worked by hourly pay rate. The result is the user’s gross pay.

Output  Display a message indicating the user’s gross pay.
```

Visualize the program running on the computer
==============================================

Before you create a program on the computer, you should first create it in your mind. Try to imagine what the computer screen will look like while the program is running. If it helps, draw pictures of the screen, with sample input and output, at various points in the program. For instance, Figure 1-8 shows the screen we might want produced by a program that implements the pay-calculating algorithm.

In this step, you must put yourself in the shoes of the user. What messages should the program display? What questions should it ask? By addressing these concerns, you can determine most of the program’s output.

Use design tools to create a model of the program
======================================================
While planning a program, the programmer uses one or more design tools to create a model of the program. For example, pseudocode is a cross between human language and a programming language and is especially helpful when designing an algorithm. Although the computer can’t understand pseudocode, programmers often find it helpful to write an algorithm in a language that’s “almost” a programming language, but still very similar to natural language. For example, here is pseudocode that describes the pay-calculating algorithm:
```
Get payroll data.
Calculate gross pay.
Display gross pay.
```
Although this pseudocode gives a broad view of the program, it doesn’t reveal all the program’s details. A more detailed version of the pseudocode follows:
```
Display “How many hours did you work?”
Input hours.
Display “How much do you get paid per hour?”
Input rate.
Store the value of hours times rate in the pay variable.
Display the value in the pay variable.
```
Notice that the pseudocode uses statements that look more like commands than the English statements that describe the algorithm in Section 1.4. The pseudocode even names variables and describes mathematical operations. 

Check the model for logical errors
=
Logical errors are mistakes that cause the program to produce erroneous results. Once a model of the program is assembled, it should be checked for these errors. For example, if pseudocode is used, the programmer should trace through it, checking the logic of each step. If an error is found, the model can be corrected before the next step is attempted.

Enter the code and compile it
=
Once a model of the program has been created, checked, and corrected, the programmer is ready to write source code on the computer. The programmer saves the source code to a file and begins the process of compiling it. During this step the compiler will find any syntax errors that may exist in the program.

Correct any errors found during compilation...and repeat the last step and this step as many times as nescessary.
=
If the compiler reports any errors, they must be corrected. Steps 5 and 6 must be repeated until the program is free of compile-time errors.

Run the program with test data for input
= 
Once an executable file is generated, the program is ready to be tested for runtime errors. A runtime error is an error that occurs while the program is running. These are usually logical errors, such as mathematical mistakes.

Testing for runtime errors requires that the program be executed with sample data or sample input. The sample data should be such that the correct output can be predicted. If the program does not produce the correct output, a logical error is present in the program.

Correct any runtime errors found while running the program. Repeat Steps 5 through 8 as many times as necessary
=
When runtime errors are found in a program, they must be corrected. You must identify the step where the error occurred and determine the cause. If an error is a result of incorrect logic (such as an improperly stated math formula), you must correct the statement or statements involved in the logic. If an error is due to an incomplete understanding of the program requirements, then you must restate the program purpose and modify the program model and source code. The program must then be saved, recompiled, and retested. This means Steps 5 through 8 must be repeated until the program reliably produces satisfactory results.

Validate the results of the program
=
When you believe you have corrected all the runtime errors, enter test data and determine whether the program solves the original problem.

Software Engineering
=
The field of software engineering encompasses the whole process of crafting computer software. It includes designing, writing, testing, debugging, documenting, modifying, and maintaining complex software development projects. Like traditional engineers, software engineers use a number of tools in their craft. Here are a few examples:

- Program specifications
- Diagrams of screen output
- Diagrams representing the program components and the flow of data
- Pseudocode
- Examples of expected input and desired output
- Special software designed for testing programs
  
Most commercial software applications are large and complex. Usually a team of programmers, not a single individual, develops them. It is important that the program requirements be thoroughly analyzed and divided into subtasks that are handled by individual teams, or individuals within a team.
