All computer systems consist of similar hardware devices and software components.

Hardware
========
- refers to the physical components that a computer is made of.
	- A computer, as we generally think of it is NOT an individual device, but a SYSTEM of devices. 
		- A typical Computer system consists of the following
  			- MAJOR COMPONENTS
				- The central Processing Unit (CPU)
				- Main Memory
				- Secondary Storage Devices
				- Input Devices

Lets take a closer look at these devices.

CPU
===
- the heart of the computer
	- Central Processing Unit
		- CPU (in Short)
	- Its job:
		- Fetch Instructions
		- Follow the Instructions
		- produce some resulting data
	- Internally, the central processing unit consists of two parts
		- Control Unit
			- Coordinates all of the computers operation
				- It is responsible for determining where to get the next instruction and regulating the other major components of the computer with control Signals
		- Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)
			- is designed to perform mathematical operations
	- As shown Below of those 2

Program 
- a sequence of instructions stored in the computer’s memory.

When a computer is running a program
- the CPU is engaged in a process known formally as the fetch/decode/execute cycle.
	- The steps in the fetch/decode/execute cycle are as follows from the graph below


============================================================================================

Fetch   |   The CPU’s control unit fetches, from main memory, the next instruction in the sequence of program instructions. 

Decode	|   The instruction is encoded in the form of a number. The control unit decodes the instruction and generates an electronic signal.
 
Execute	|   The signal is routed to the appropriate component of the computer (such as the ALU, a disk drive, or some other device). The signal causes the
	    component to perform an operation.
     
============================================================================================

Main Memory
===========
- Commonly known as random access memory
	- RAM
		- For Short
- A device that holds information.
- What it does more Specifically, is that it holds the sequences of instructions in the programs that are running and the data those programs are using.

Memory is divided into sections that hold an equal amount of data. 
- Each section is made of eight “switches” that may be either
	- on
 	- off

A switch in the on position 
- Represents the number 1

A switch in the off position
- Represents the number 0.

The computer stores data by setting the switches in a memory location to a pattern that represents a character or a number. Each of these switches is known as a bit - which stands for binary digit.

**Bit / Binary Digit**
- A Storage Location in the computer's memory that can be set to either 1 or 0.

Each section of memory, which is a collection of eight bits, is known as a byte - Each byte is assigned a unique number known as an **address**.

**Byte**
- A Storage location in the computer's Memory's memory that is of 8 bits

The addresses are ordered from lowest to highest. A byte is identified by its address in much the same way a post office box is identified by an address.

**Address**
- A unique number that identifies the location of a specific byte in the computer's memory.

The Image Below shows a series of bytes with their addresses. In the illustration, sample data is stored in memory. The number 149 is stored in the byte at address 16, and the number 72 is stored in the byte at address 23.

RAM is usually a volatile type of memory, used only for temporary storage. When the computer is turned off, the contents of RAM are erased.

Secondary Storage
==================

Secondary storage
- type of memory that can hold data for long periods of time—even when there is no power to the computer.
    - Frequently used programs are
 	  - stored in secondary memory
      - loaded into main memory as needed.
    - LIKE these 3 that is saved to secondary storage as well.
      - Important data, such as word processing documents
      - payroll data
      - inventory figures
       

The most common type of secondary storage device is the disk drive. 
- A traditional disk drive stores data by magnetically encoding it onto a spinning circular disk.

**Disk Drive**
- A Secondary storage device that stores by magnifying encoding into a spinning circular disc

Solid state drives, 
- which store data in solid-state memory,
are increasingly becoming popular. A solid-state drive has no moving parts, and operates faster than a traditional disk drive.

Most computers have some sort of secondary storage device, either a traditional disk drive or a solid-state drive, mounted inside their case. External drives are also available, which connect to one of the computer’s communication ports. External drives can be used to create backup copies of important data or to move data to another computer.

In addition to external drives, many types of devices have been created for copying data, and for moving it to other computers. Universal Serial Bus drives, or USB drives are small devices that plug into the computer’s USB (Universal Serial Bus) port, and appear to the system as a disk drive. These drives do not actually contain a disk, however. They store data in a special type of memory known as flash memory. USB drives are inexpensive, reliable, and small enough to be carried in your pocket.

Input Devices
Input is any data the computer collects from the outside world. The device that collects the data and sends it to the computer is called an input device. Common input devices are the keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone, and digital camera. Disk drives and USB drives can also be considered input devices because programs and data are retrieved from them and loaded into the computer’s memory.

Output Devices
Output is any data the computer sends to the outside world. It might be a sales report, a list of names, or an image. The data is sent to an output device, which formats and presents it. Common output devices are monitors and printers. Disk drives and USB drives can also be considered output devices because the CPU sends data to them to be saved.

Software
As previously mentioned, software refers to the programs that run on a computer. There are two general categories of software: operating systems and application software. An operating system is a set of programs that manages the computer’s hardware devices and controls their processes. Most all modern operating systems are multitasking, which means they are capable of running multiple programs at once. Through a technique called time sharing, a multitasking system divides the allocation of hardware resources and the attention of the CPU among all the executing programs. Windows, Linux, and macOS, are multitasking operating systems.

Application software refers to programs that make the computer useful to the user. These programs solve specific problems or perform general operations that satisfy the needs of the user. Word processing, spreadsheet, and database packages are all examples of application software.
