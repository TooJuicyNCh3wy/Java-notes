**CONCEPT**: 
- A Java program has parts that serve specific purposes.

Java programs are made up of different parts. Your first step in learning Java is to learn what the parts are. We will begin by looking at a simple example, shown in Code Listing 2-1.

```
Code Listing 2-1 (Simple.java)
// This is a simple Java program. 
      
public class Simple 
{ 
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   { 
      System.out.println("Programming is great fun!"); 
   } 
}
```
**TIP**: Remember, the line numbers shown in the program listings are not part of the program. The numbers are shown so we can refer to specific lines in the programs.

As mentioned in Chapter 1, the names of Java source code files end with .java. The program shown in Code Listing 2-1 is named Simple.java. Using the Java compiler, this program may be compiled with the following command:

```
javac Simple.java
```

The compiler will create another file named Simple.class, which contains the translated Java byte code. This file can be executed with the following command:

```
java Simple
```  
**TIP**: Remember, you do not type the .class extension when using the java command.

The output of the program is as follows. This is what appears on the screen when the program runs.
```
Program Output
Programming is great fun!
```
Lets’s examine the program line by line. Here’s the statement in line 1:
```
// This is a simple Java program.
```
Other than the two slash marks that begin this line, it looks pretty much like an ordinary sentence. The // marks the beginning of a comment. The compiler ignores everything from the double-slash to the end of the line. That means you can type anything you want on that line and the compiler never complains. Although comments are not required, they are very important to programmers. Most programs are much more complicated than this example, and comments help explain what’s going on.

Line 2 is blank. Programmers often insert blank lines in programs to make them easier to read. Line 3 reads:
```
public class Simple
```  
This line is known as a class header, and it marks the beginning of a class definition. One of the uses of a class is to serve as a container for an application. As you progress through this book, you will learn more and more about classes. For now, just remember that a Java program must have at least one class definition. This line of code consists of three words: public, class, and Simple. Let’s take a closer look at each word.

- ```public``` is a Java keyword, and it must be written in all lowercase letters. It is known as an access specifier, and it controls where the class may be accessed from. The public specifier means access to the class is unrestricted. (In other words, the class is “open to the public.”)
- ```class```, which must also be written in lowercase letters, is a Java keyword that indicates the beginning of a class definition.
- ```Simple``` is the class name. This name was made up by the programmer. The class could have been called Pizza, or Dog, or anything else the programmer wanted. Programmer-defined names may be written in lowercase letters, uppercase letters, or a mixture of both.
  
In a nutshell, this line of code tells the compiler that a publicly accessible class named Simple is being defined. Here are two more points to know about classes:

- You may create more than one class in a file, but you may have only one public class per Java file.
- When a Java file has a public class, the name of the public class must be the same as the name of the file (without the .java extension). For instance, the program in Code Listing 2-1 has a public class named Simple, so it is stored in a file named Simple.java.

**NOTE**: Java is a case-sensitive language. That means it regards uppercase letters as being entirely different characters than their lowercase counterparts. The word Public is not the same as public, and Class is not the same as class. Some words in a Java program must be entirely in lowercase, while other words may use a combination of lower and uppercase characters. Later in this chapter, you will see a list of all the Java keywords, which must appear in lowercase.

Line 4 contains only a single character:
```
{
```
This is called a left brace, or an opening brace, and is associated with the beginning of the class definition. All of the programming statements that are part of the class are enclosed in a set of braces. If you glance at the last line in the program, line 9, you’ll see the closing brace. Everything between the two braces is the body of the class named Simple. Here is the program code again, this time the body of the class definition is shaded.
```
// This is a simple Java program.  
public class Simple  
{  
   public static void main(String[] args)  
   { 
      System.out.println("Programming is great fun!");  
   }  
}
```
**WARNING!** Make sure you have a closing brace for every opening brace in your program!

Line 5 reads:
```
public static void main(String[] args)
```

This line is known as a method header. It marks the beginning of a method. A method can be thought of as a group of one or more programming statements that collectively has a name. When creating a method, you must tell the compiler several things about it. That is why this line contains so many words. At this point, the only thing you should be concerned about is that the name of the method is main, and the rest of the words are required for the method to be properly defined. This is shown in Figure 2-1.

Recall from Chapter 1 that a stand-alone Java program that runs on your computer is known as an application. Every Java application must have a method named main. The main method is the starting point of an application.

**NOTE**: For the time being, all the programs you will write will consist of a class with a main method whose header looks exactly like the one shown in Code Listing 2-1. As you progress through this book you will learn what public static void and (String[] args) mean. For now, just assume that you are learning a “recipe” for assembling a Java program.

Line 6 has another opening brace:
```
{ 
```
This opening brace belongs to the main method. Remember that braces enclose statements, and every opening brace must have an accompanying closing brace. If you look at line 8 you will see the closing brace that corresponds with this opening brace. Everything between these braces is the body of the main method.

Line 7 appears as follows:
```
System.out.println("Programming is great fun!");
```
To put it simply, this line displays a message on the screen. The message, “Programming is great fun!” is printed without the quotation marks. In programming terms, the group of characters inside the quotation marks is called a string literal.

**NOTE**: This is the only line in the program that causes anything to be printed on the screen. The other lines, like public class Simple and public static void main(String[] args), are necessary for the framework of your program, but they do not cause any screen output. Remember, a program is a set of instructions for the computer. If something is to be displayed on the screen, you must use a programming statement for that purpose.

At the end of the line is a semicolon. Just as a period marks the end of a sentence, a semicolon marks the end of a statement in Java. Not every line of code ends with a semicolon, however. Here is a summary of where you do not place a semicolon:

- Comments do not have to end with a semicolon because they are ignored by the compiler.
- Class headers and method headers do not end with a semicolon because they are terminated with a body of code inside braces.
- The brace characters, { and }, are not statements, so you do not place a semicolon after them.

It might seem that the rules for where to put a semicolon are not clear at all. For now, just concentrate on learning the parts of a program. You’ll soon get a feel for where you should and should not use semicolons.

As has already been pointed out, lines 8 and 9 contain the closing braces for the main method and the class definition:
```
   }  
}
```
Before continuing, let’s review the points we just covered, including some of the more elusive rules.

- Java is a case-sensitive language. It does not regard uppercase letters as being the same character as their lowercase equivalents.
- All Java programs must be stored in a file with a name that ends with .java.
- Comments are ignored by the compiler.
- A .java file may contain many classes, but may have only one public class. If a .java file has a public class, the class must have the same name as the file. For instance, if the file Pizza.java contains a public class, the class’s name would be Pizza.
- Every Java application program must have a method named main.
- For every left brace, or opening brace, there must be a corresponding right brace, or closing brace.
- Statements are terminated with semicolons. This does not include comments, class headers, method headers, or braces.

In the sample program, you encountered several special characters. Table 2-1 summarizes how they were used.

```
