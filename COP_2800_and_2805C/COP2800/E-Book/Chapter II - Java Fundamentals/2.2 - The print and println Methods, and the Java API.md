**CONCEPT**: 
- The ```print``` and ```println``` methods are used to display text output. They are part of the Java API, which is a collection of prewritten classes and methods for performing specific operations

In this section, you will learn how to write programs that produce output on the screen. The simplest type of output that a program can display on the screen is console output. Console output is merely plain text. When you display console output in a system that uses a graphical user interface, such as Windows or Mac OS, the output usually appears in a window similar to the one shown in Figure 2-2.

The word console is an old computer term. It comes from the days when the operator of a large computer system interacted with the system by typing on a terminal that consisted of a simple screen and keyboard. This terminal was known as the console. The console screen, which displayed only text, was known as the standard output device. Today, the term standard output device typically refers to the device that displays console output.

Performing output in Java, as well as many other tasks, is accomplished by using the Java API. The term API stands for Application Programmer Interface. The API is a standard library of prewritten classes for performing specific operations. These classes and their methods are available to all Java programs. The print and println methods are part of the API and provide ways for output to be displayed on the standard output device.

The program in Code Listing 2-1 (Simple.java) uses the following statement to print a message on the screen:

```
System.out.println("Programming is great fun!");  
```

System is a class that is part of the Java API. The System class contains objects and methods that perform system-level operations. One of the objects contained in the System class is named out. The out object has methods, such as print and println, for performing output on the system console, or standard output device. The hierarchical relationship among System, out, print, and println is shown in Figure 2-3.

Relationship among the System class, the out object, and the print and println methods

![FG_02_003](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/971a1c1d-aa55-4966-91c8-056d815bfcbf)

Here is a brief summary of how it all works together:

- The System class is part of the Java API. It has member objects and methods for performing system-level operations, such as sending output to the console.
- The out object is a member of the System class. It provides methods for sending output to the screen.
The print and println methods are members of the out object. They actually perform the work of writing characters on the screen.
- This hierarchy explains why the statement that executes println is so long. The sequence System.out.println specifies that println is a member of out, which is a member of System.

**NOTE**: The period that separates the names of the objects is pronounced “dot.” System.out.println is pronounced “system dot out dot print line.”

The value that is to be displayed on the screen is placed inside the parentheses. This value is known as an argument. For example, the following statement executes the println method using the string "King Arthur" as its argument. This will print “King Arthur” on the screen. (The quotation marks are not displayed.)

```
System.out.println("King Arthur");  
```
An important thing to know about the println method is that after it displays its message, it advances the cursor to the beginning of the next line. The next item printed on the screen will begin in this position. For example, look at the program in Code Listing 2-2.
```
Code Listing 2-2 (TwoLines Java)

// This is another simple Java program. 
     
public class TwoLines 
{ 
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   { 
      System.out.println("Programming is great fun!"); 
      System.out.println("I can’t get enough of it!"); 
   } 
}

=======================================================
Program Output
=======================================================

Programming is great fun!
I can’t get enough of it!
```

Because each string is printed with separate println statements in Code Listing 2-2, they appear on separate lines in the Program Output.

# The Print Method
- The print method, which is also part of the System.out object, serves a purpose similar to that of println—to display output on the screen. The print method, however, does not advance the cursor to the next line after its message is displayed.

look at the Code Listing 2-3
```
Code Listing 2-3 (GreatFun.Java)

// This is another simple Java program. 
    
public class GreatFun 
{ 
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   { 
      System.out.print("Programming is "); 
      System.out.println("great fun!"); 
   } 
}

=========================================
Program Output
=========================================

Programming is great fun!
```
An important concept to understand about Code Listing 2-3 is that, although the output is broken up into two programming statements, this program will still display the message on one line. The data that you send to the print method is displayed in a continuous stream. Sometimes this can produce less-than-desirable results. The program in Code Listing 2-4 is an example.

```
Code Listing 2-4 (Uruly.java)

// An unruly printing program 
    
public class Unruly  
{ 
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   { 
      System.out.print("These are our top sellers:"); 
      System.out.print("Computer games"); 
      System.out.print("Coffee"); 
      System.out.println("Aspirin"); 
   } 
}

======================================================
Program Output
======================================================

These are our top sellers:Computer gamesCoffeeAspirin
```

The layout of the actual output looks nothing like the arrangement of the strings in the source code. First, even though the output is broken up into four lines in the source code (lines 7 through 10), it comes out on the screen as one line. Second, notice that some of the words that are displayed are not separated by spaces. The strings are displayed exactly as they are sent to the print method. If spaces are to be displayed, they must appear in the strings.



There are two ways to fix this program. The most obvious way is to use println methods instead of print methods. Another way is to use escape sequences to separate the output into different lines. An escape sequence starts with the backslash character (\), and is followed by one or more control characters. It allows you to control the way output is displayed by embedding commands within the string itself. The escape sequence that causes the output cursor to go to the next line is \n. Code Listing 2-5 illustrates its use.

```
Code Listing 2-5 (Adjusted.java)
// A well adjusted printing program 
    
public class Adjusted 
{ 
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   { 
      System.out.print("These are our top sellers:\n"); 
      System.out.print("Computer games\nCoffee\n"); 
      System.out.println("Aspirin"); 
   } 
}
=======================
    Program Output
=======================
These are our top sellers:
Computer games
Coffee
Aspirin
```

The \n characters are called the newline escape sequence. When the print or println method encounters \n in a string, it does not print the \n characters on the screen, but interprets them as a special command to advance the output cursor to the next line. There are several other escape sequences as well. For instance, \t is the tab escape sequence. When print or println encounters it in a string, it causes the output cursor to advance to the next tab position. Code Listing 2-6 shows it in use.

```
Code Listing 2-6 (Tabs.java)

/ Another well-adjusted printing program 
   
public class Tabs 
{ 
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   { 
      System.out.print("These are our top sellers:\n"); 
      System.out.print("\tComputer games\n\tCoffee\n"); 
      System.out.println("\tAspirin"); 
   } 
}

================
Program Output
===============

These are our top sellers:
        Computer games
        Coffee
        Aspirin
```
**NOTE**:  Although you have to type two characters to write an escape sequence, they are stored in memory as a single character.

Table 2-2 lists the common escape sequences and describes them.
```
Table 2-2 Common escape sequences
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Escape Sequence          Name                                    Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      \n               Newline              Advances the cursor to the next line for subsequent printing

      \t             Horizontal tab             Causes the cursor to skip over to the next tab stop

      \b               Backspace              Causes the cursor to back up, or move left, one position

      \r                Return      Causes the cursor to go to the beginning of the current line, not the next line

      \\              Backslash                          Causes a backslash to be printed

      \'            Single quote                   Causes a single quotation mark to be printed

      \"            Double quote                   Causes a double quotation mark to be printed

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
**WARNING**: Do not confuse the backslash (```\```) with the forward slash (/). An escape sequence will not work if you accidentally start it with a forward slash. Also, do not put a space between the backslash and the control character.
