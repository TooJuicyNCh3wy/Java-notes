**Concept**
- Java provides many operators for manipulating numeric values and performing calculations.

Java offers a multitude of operators for manipulating data. Generally, there are three types of operators: unary, binary, and ternary. These terms reflect the number of operands an operator requires.

Unary operators require only a single operand. For example, consider the following expression:
```
-5
```
Of course, we understand this represents the value negative five. We can also apply the operator to a variable, as follows:
```
â€“number
```  
This expression gives the negative of the value stored in number. The minus sign, when used this way, is called the negation operator. Because it requires only one operand, it is a unary operator.

Binary operators work with two operands. The assignment operator is in this category. Ternary operators, as you may have guessed, require three operands. Java has only one ternary operator, which is discussed in Chapter 3.

Arithmetic operations are very common in programming. Table 2-7 shows the arithmetic operators in Java.
