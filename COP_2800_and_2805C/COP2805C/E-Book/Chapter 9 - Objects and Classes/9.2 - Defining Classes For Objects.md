**Key Point**
- _a Class defines the properties and behaviors for objects._

# State of an object
Object-Oriented Programming 
- OR OOP for Short
  - involes programming object
 
Object represents an entity in the real world that can be distincly identified

EXAMPLE
```
- Student
- desk
- circle
- button
- loan
```
All of these can be viewed as objects

An Object has a Unique identity, state, and behavior
- the **_State_** of an Object
  - AKA its Properties **OR** Attributes
    -  is Represented by _Data Fields_ with their current values.
    -  EXAMPLE
```
A Circle Object as the EXAMPLE
has a Data field
- Radius
which is the property that characterize a circle
```
```
A rectangle object as the EXAMPLE
has the data field(s)
- width
- height
which are the propertes that characterize a rectangle.
```
the **_behavior_** of an object
- AKA its actions
  - is defined by methods
  - to invoke a method on an object is to ask the object to perform an action.
    - EXAMPLE

you may define methods named
```
getArea();
getPerimeter();
```
for Circle objects

A Circle object can invoke
```
getArea();
```
to return its area and
```
getPerimeter();
```
to return its perimeter

you may also define this method
```
setRadius(radius);
```
A Circle Object can invoke this method to change its radius.

----------------------------------------------------
# Contract / Objects
Objects of the same type are defined using a common _class_
Class
- A Template, blueprint, or contract that defines what an object's data fields and methods would be.

Object
- an instance of a class

You can create instances of a class. Creating a instance is reffered to as **_instantiation_**.

The terms object and instance are often interchangeable.

This Below shows a class named ```Circle``` and its 3 objects

# Method 
A Java Class uses variables to define data fields and methods to define actions

In Addition, 
- a class provides methods of a special type
  - known as **_Constructors_**
    - which are invoked to create a new object

A Constructor can perform any action...**BUT**...constructors are designed to perfrom initializing actions
- SUCH AS
  - initializing the data fields of objects

These code(s) below shows an EXAMPLE of defining the class for circle objects.

Remember:
- A Class is a Construct that Defines objects of the same type
```
class Circle {
```
```
  /** Data Fields */

  /** The Radius of the Circle */
  double radius = 1;
```
```
  /** Constructors */

  /** Construct a circle object */
  Circle() {              
  }

  /** Construct a circle object */
  Circle(double newRadius) {
    radius = newRadius;
  }
```
```
  /** Methods */

  /** Return the Area of this Circle */
  double getArea() {
    return radius * radius * Math.PI;
  }

  /** Return the Perimeter of this circle */
  double getPerimeter() {
    return 2 * radius * Math.PI;
  }

  /** Set a new radius for this circle */
  void setRadius(double newRadius) {
    radius = newRadius;
  }
}
```
# Main Class
The ```Circle``` Class is different from all of the other classes you have seen thus far

It does not have the ```main``` Method, and therefore, cannot be run; it is merely a definition for circle objects. The class that contains the ```main``` Method will be referred to in his book, for convinience, as the main class.

# Class Diagram
The illustration of class templates and objects in the image above can be standardized using **_Unified Modeling Language (UML)_** notation.

This notation as shown below is called a UML Class diagram...

Or

simply a _class diagram_. in the class diagram, the data field is denoted as
```
dataFieldName: dataFieldType
```
REMEMBER:
- Classes and Objects can be represented using UML notation.

The constructor is denoted as:
```
ClassName(parameterName: parameterType)
```
The Method is denoted as
```
methodName(parameterName: parameterType): returnType
```
