  *Key Point**
- _Classes are definitions for objects and objects are created from classes_

---------------------------------------

From this sections its giving 2 EXAMPLES of defining classes and usess the classes to create objects. ```TestCircle.java``` is a program that defines the ```Circle class and uses it to create objects. Thhe program constructs 3 circle objects

WITH RADIUS
- 1
- 25
- 125

And displays the ```radius``` and ```area``` of each of the 3 circles.

which will then change the radius of the second object to 100 and displays its new radius and area

----------------------------------------
# TestCircle.java
(ignore the word ```newRadius``` @ line 8 & 12 idk why it saids```newRadius:``` but it just saids it)

**OUTPUT**

The Program has 2 classes
- ```TestCircle```
  - the main class
    - Its purpose?
      - to test the Second class
        - ```Circle```
       
This tyoe of program that uses the class is often reffered to as a _client_ in the main class

When you run the program,
- Java runtime invokes the ```main``` method in the main class.

you can actually put the 2 Classes into one file

BUT

-----------------------------------------------------
**ONLY ONE CLASS IN FILE CAN BE A PUBLIC CLASS**

-----------------------------------------------------
And
- public class **MUST** have the same name as the file name

so

- the file **MUST** be ```TestCircle.java``` as well
  - because if not
    - file wont run at all
  
Each class in the source is compiled into a ```.class```

When you compile ```TestCircle.java```
- 2 class files
  - ```TestCircle.class```
  - ```Circle.class```

will be generated

you think it wont?

look at the image below

-------------------------------
Remember:

Each Class in the source code file is compiled in a ```.class``` file.

-----------------------------------

The main class contains the ```main``` method **(In Line 2 (from the image above))** That Creates 3 ojects

As creating an array
- The ```new``` Operator is used to create an object from the constructor:
  -  ```new Circle()```
      - Creates an object with radius 1 **(Line 4)**
  - ```new Circle(25)```
      - Creates an object with radius 25 **(line 8)**
  - ```new Circle(125)```
      - Creates an object with radius 125 **(line 12)**
   
These 3 objects
- circle1
- circle2
- circle3

have different data but the same mathods

therefore

you can compute their respective areas using the ```getArea()``` method. The data fields can be accessed via the reference of the object using ```circle1.radius```, ```circle2.radius``` , and ```circle3.radius``` respectively. The object can invoke its method via the reference of the object using ```circle1.getArea()```, ```circle2.getArea()```, and ```circle3.getArea() ``` respectively.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
As another example, consider television sets

each tv is an object with states (current channel, current volume level, and power on or off) and behaviors (change channels, adjust volume, and turn on/off). You can use a class to model TV sets. The UML diagram for the class is shown in the image below 

![535be069d12abbc776ef106a27d3614a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/346eea40-828e-4a20-bcf6-a4ab985cd1e0)

an the file ```TV.java``` gives a program that defines the **TV** class

----------------------------------------------
# TV.java

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90015354-79f1-4df0-9cdd-11a6ad56da78)

-----------------------------------------------
The Constructor and methods in the ```TV``` Class are defined public so they can be accessed from other classes.

-------------------------------------------
**Note:**
the channel and volume level are not changed if the TV is not on. Before either of these is changed, its changed value is checked to ensure it is within the correct range

-------------------------------------------
```TestTV.java``` gives a program that uses the ```TV``` class to create 2 objects

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/797ee53b-5eae-4f1c-a612-45d77b452150)

OUTPUT:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b09603f9-e9ba-4b38-bb66-3bcbcb038fa4)

The program creates two objects in lines 3 & 8 and invokes the methods on the objects to perform actions for setting channels and volume levels and for increasing channels and volume.

The program displays the channel's numbers and volumes at lines 15 - 17 (from the image).

The methods are invoked using syntax such as ```tv1.turnOn()``` on line 4. 

The data fields are accessed using syntax such as ```tv1.channel``` on line 15

---------------------------------------------------- 
These examples have given you a glimpse of classes and objects. You may have many questions reguarding:
- Constructors
- objects
- reference variables
- accessing data fields
- invoking object's methods

The sections that will follow discuss these issues in much detail

-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Check Point

**9.3.1** Describe the relationship between an object and its defining class.
- The relationship of an object and a defining class is one having a class that, one, can be public and the other ```class``` and generates those 2 classes as different sections and while object can create an object by using the variable and converting that variable to a new object from ```TestCircle.java```, ```Circle circle1 = new Circle();``` creates the object from the public class and for ```Circle``` becomes a ```class``` it helps the object to become what it was meant to do. and thats the relationship of a ```class``` and an object
              
**9.3.2** How do you define a class?
- one is class and the other is public class
              
**9.3.3** How do you declare an objectâ€™s reference variable?
- by using the ```class``` and from the code on the method where you would put the name of the ```class``` with the variable adn then adding ```new``` and using the constructor created also ```Circle()```
              
**9.3.4** How do you create an object?
- for starters by usinng the ```public class``` which is the ```.java```'s file name. Then, from the main method you task the class, which again, use ```TestCircle.java``` as the example, you task the class ```Circle``` as the new object, therefore using the ```class``` name, now adding the variable of the object, being ```circle1```, to equal the new constructor, ```new Circle()``` and adding them all together is this
```
Circle circle1 = new Circle();
```
