**Key Point**
- _Classes are definitions for objects and objects are created from classes_

---------------------------------------

From this sections its giving 2 EXAMPLES of defining classes and usess the classes to create objects. ```TestCircle.java``` is a program that defines the ```Circle class and uses it to create objects. Thhe program constructs 3 circle objects

WITH RADIUS
- 1
- 25
- 125

And displays the ```radius``` and ```area``` of each of the 3 circles.

which will then change the radius of the second object to 100 and displays its new radius and area

----------------------------------------
# TestCircle.java
(ignore the word ```newRadius``` @ line 8 & 12 idk why it saids```newRadius:``` but it just saids it)

**OUTPUT**

The Program has 2 classes
- ```TestCircle```
  - the main class
    - Its purpose?
      - to test the Second class
        - ```Circle```
       
This tyoe of program that uses the class is often reffered to as a _client_ in the main class

When you run the program,
- Java runtime invokes the ```main``` method in the main class.

you can actually put the 2 Classes into one file

BUT

-----------------------------------------------------
**ONLY ONE CLASS IN FILE CAN BE A PUBLIC CLASS**

-----------------------------------------------------
And
- public class **MUST** have the same name as the file name

so

- the file **MUST** be ```TestCircle.java``` as well
  - because if not
    - file wont run at all
  
Each class in the source is compiled into a ```.class```

When you compile ```TestCircle.java```
- 2 class files
  - ```TestCircle.class```
  - ```Circle.class```

will be generated

you think it wont?

look at the image below

-------------------------------
Remember:

Each Class in the source code file is compiled in a ```.class``` file.

The main class contains the ```main``` method **(In Line 2 (from the image above))** That Creates 3 ojects

As creating an array
- The ```new``` Operator is used to create an object from the constructor:
  -  ```new Circle()```
      - Creates an object with radius 1 **(Line 4)**
  - ```new Circle(25)```
      - Creates an object with radius 25 **(line 8)**
  - ```new Circle(125)```
      - Creates an object with radius 125 **(line 12)**
   
These 3 objects
- circle1
- circle2
- circle3

have different data but the same mathods

therefore

you can compute their respective areas using the ```getArea()``` method. The data fields can be accessed via the reference of the object using ```circle1.radius```, ```circle2.radius``` , and ```circle3.radius``` respectively. The object can invoke its method via the reference of the object using ```circle1.getArea()```, ```circle2.getArea()```, and ```circle3.getArea() ``` respectively.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
As another example, consider television sets

each tv is an object with states (current channel, current volume level, and power on or off) and behaviors (change channels, adjust volume, and turn on/off). You can use a class to model TV sets. The UML diagram for the class is shown in the image below

an the file ```TV.java``` gives a program that defines the **TV** class
