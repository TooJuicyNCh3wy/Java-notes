**Key Point**
- _Classes are definitions for objects and objects are created from classes_

---------------------------------------

From this sections its giving 2 EXAMPLES of defining classes and usess the classes to create objects. ```TestCircle.java``` is a program that defines the ```Circle class and uses it to create objects. Thhe program constructs 3 circle objects

WITH RADIUS
- 1
- 25
- 125

And displays the ```radius``` and ```area``` of each of the 3 circles.

which will then change the radius of the second object to 100 and displays its new radius and area

# TestCircle.java
