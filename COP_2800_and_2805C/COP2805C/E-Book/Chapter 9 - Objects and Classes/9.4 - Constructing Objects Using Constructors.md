# Constructing Objects Using Constructors

**Key Point**
- A **_Constructor_** is invoked to create an object using the new operator.

-----------------------------
Constructors are a special kind of method

There are 3 kinds of pecularities
- **Constructor's Name**
  - A constructor must have the same name as the ```class``` itself
- **no return type**
  - Constructors do not have a return type-not even ```void```
- ```new``` **operator**
  - Constructors are invoked using the ```new``` operator when an object is created. Constructors play the role of initializing objects.

-------------------------------------------------
# Overloade constructors
The constructor had exactly the same name as its defining class.

Like regular methods
  - Constructors can be overloaded, making it easy to construct objects with different initial data values
    - EXAMPLE
      - Multiple constructors can have the same name but different signatures

------------------------------

# No ```void```
it is a common mistake to put the ```void``` keyword in front of a constructor

Like this one right here
```
public void Circle() {
}
```
in this case, ```Circle``` is a **Method, NOT AS A CONSTRUCTOR**

-------------------------------------------------------------------
# Constructing objects 
Constructors are used to construct oobjects. to construct an object from a class, invoke a constructor of the class using the ```new``` operator

As Shown Below:
```
new ClassName(arguments);
```
EXAMPLE:
- ```new Circle()``` creates an objects of the ```Circle``` class using the first constructor defined in the ```Circle``` class, and new
