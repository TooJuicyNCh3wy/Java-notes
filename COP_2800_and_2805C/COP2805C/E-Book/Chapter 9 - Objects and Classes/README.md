Object-oriented programming (O O P) involves programming using objects. An object represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified. For example, a student, a desk, a circle, a button, and even a loan can all be viewed as objects. An object has a unique identity, state, and behaviors. The state of an object consists of a set of data fields (also known as properties) with their current values. The behavior of an object is defined by a set of methods.

An object has both a state and behavior. The state defines the object, and the behavior defines what the object does.

```
Class name, Circle.
Data fields. Radius is, blank space. Methods, getArea.
Three objects of the Circle class are as follows.
Circle object 1. Data fields, radius is 10.
Circle object 2. Data fields, radius is 25.
Circle object 3. Data fields, radius is 125.
```

Classes are constructs that define objects of the same type. A Java class uses variables to define data fields and methods to define behaviors. Additionally, a class provides a special type of methods, known as constructors, which are invoked to construct objects from the class.
