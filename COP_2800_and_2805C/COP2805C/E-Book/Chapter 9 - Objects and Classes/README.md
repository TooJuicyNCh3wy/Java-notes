Object-oriented programming (O O P) involves programming using objects. An **object** represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified. For example, a student, a desk, a circle, a button, and even a loan can all be viewed as objects. An object has a unique identity, state, and behaviors. The **state** of an object consists of a set of **data fields** (also known as **properties**) with their current values. The behavior of an object is defined by a set of methods.

An object has both a state and behavior. The state defines the object, and the behavior defines what the object does.

```
Class name, Circle.
Data fields. Radius is, blank space. Methods, getArea.
Three objects of the Circle class are as follows.
Circle object 1. Data fields, radius is 10.
Circle object 2. Data fields, radius is 25.
Circle object 3. Data fields, radius is 125.
```

**Classes** are constructs that define objects of the same type. A Java class uses variables to define data fields and methods to define behaviors. Additionally, a class provides a special type of methods, known as constructors, which are invoked to construct objects from the class.

Constructors are a special kind of methods that are invoked to construct objects.

A constructor with no parameters is referred to as a **no-arg constructor**.
* Constructors must have the same name as the class itself.
* Constructors do not have a return typeâ€”not even void.
* Constructors are invoked using the new operator when an object is created. Constructors play the role of initializing objects.

new ClassName();
```
EXAMPLE:
```
new Circle();

new Circle(5.0);
```

A class may be defined without constructors. In this case, a no-arg constructor with an empty body is implicitly defined in the class. This constructor, called a **default** **constructor**, is provided automatically **only if no constructors are explicitly defined in the class**

To reference an object, assign the object to a reference variable.

To declare a reference variable, use the syntax:
```
ClassName objectRefVar;
```
Example:
```
Circle myCircle;
```
-------------------------
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b39befb-ad88-4977-90d6-d7276403db57)
```
ClassName objectRefVar = new ClassName();
```
Example:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d47ab80c-0bcb-4849-9d90-7ce3adb30d13)

An arrow from right side to the left side of = is labeled, assign object reference. The object new circle left parenthesis right parenthesis semi colon is labeled, create an object.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cfcd6d4-1a77-493c-916e-832c844f10b9)
* Referencing the Object's Data:
```
objectRefVar.data
```
EXAMPLE
```
myCircle.radius
```
* Invoking the object's method:
```
objectRefVar.methodName(arguments)
```
EXAMPLE
```
myCircle.getArea()
```
