# Using Classes from the Java Library
**Key Point**
- _The Java API contains a rich set of classe for developing Java Programs_

From going back to 9.3 < TestCircle.java

https://github.com/aalons012/Java-notes/blob/main/COP_2800_and_2805C/COP2805C/E-Book/Chapter%209%20-%20Objects%20and%20Classes/9.3%20Example%20-%20Defining%20Classes%20%26%20Creating%20Objects.md#testcirclejava

it defined the ```Circle``` class and created objects from the class. You will frequently use the classes in Java library tp develop programs.

This Section gives some examples of the classes in the Java library

--------------------------------------------------------------------
# 9.6.1 - The ```Date``` Class
```java.util.Date``` Class

In Chapter 2 Source Codes, ```ShowCurrentTime.Java```

Link: https://plus.pearson.com/epub/bronte/BRNT-26GBB13RNR6/v14/OPS/xhtml/ef8bdc60-e677-11ec-8fa2-fe276b0b0ebf.xhtml#1ccb22bd391467c20df32e267d570d94

You learned how to obtain the current time by using 
```
System.currentTimeMillis()
```
You used the division and remaider operators to extract the current second, minute, and hour.

Java provides a system-independent encapsulation of date and time in the ```java.util.Date``` class. As shown below

--------------------------
A ```Date``` object represents a specific date and time

![s adfs jmikoafios jafiosa os  as sa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ed543d-b1f7-42f1-b0a8-b5c21c7a4477)

------------------
You can use the no-arg constructor in the ```Date``` class to create an instance for the current date and time

The ```getTime()``` method to return the elapsed time in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, GMT, and the ```toString()``` method to return the date and time as a string

EXAMPLE

The Following Code:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99bd7d83-5e30-4676-b111-75f84870f3f9)

Output:
```
The elapsed time since Jan 1, 1970 is 1324903419651 milliseconds
Mon Dec 26 07:43:39 EST 2011
```
The ```Date``` class has another constructor
```
Date(long elapseTime)
```
which can be used to construct a ```Date``` object for a given time in milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970, GMT

----------------------------------------
# 9.6.2 - The ```Random``` Class
You have used ```Math.random()``` to obtain a random ```double``` value between 0.0 and 1.0
- EXCLUDING 1.0

Another way to generate random numbers is to use the ```java.util.Random``` class, 

As shown from the image below, which can generate a random ```int, long, double, float``` and ```boolean``` value.

----------------------------------
A ```Random``` object can be used to generate random values

![076ab168eb146f078c49047d71dbfd7c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeeae18b-8d6b-466e-af1b-5c49eb4ac547)

When you create a ```random``` object, you have to specify a speed or use the default speed. A Seed is a Number used to initialize a random number generator

The no-arg constructor creates a ```Random``` object using the current elapsed time as its seed

If 2 ```Random``` objects have the same speed, they will generate identical sequences of numbers

EXAMPLE

For the Following code creates two ```Random``` objects with the SAME seed,```3```:
```
Random ggenerator = new Random(3);
System.out.print("From generator1: ");
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)

  System.out.print(generator1.nextInt(1000) + " ");

Random generator2 = new Random(3);
System.out.print("\nFrom generator2: ");
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)

  System.out.print(generator2.nextInt(1000) + " ");
```
The code generates the same sequence of random ```int``` values:
```
From generator1: 734 660 210 581 128 202 549 564 459 961

From generator2: 734 660 210 581 128 202 549 564 459 961
```
-------------------------
# Note - Same Sequence
The ability to generate the same sequece of random values is useful in software testing and many other applications. In Software testing, often you need to reproduce the test cases from a fixed sequence of random numbers

--------------------------
# Note - ```SecureRandom```
You can generate random numbers using the ```java.security.SecureRandom``` class rather than the ```Random``` class. The random numbers generated from the ```Random``` are deterministic and they can be predicted by hackers. the random numbers generated from the ```SecureRandom``` class are nondeterministic and are secure.

-----------------------
# 9.6.3 - The ```Point2D``` Class
Java API has a convinient ```Point2D``` class in the ```javafx.geometry``` package for representing a pint in a Two-Dimensional plane.

The UML diagram for the class is shown below

------------------------------------------------
A ```Point2D``` object represents a point with x- and y-coordinates.

![44aaa4b7b800bb15b44e6ae1bb415f5f](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9e94852-2d6e-4bb1-8272-6348cb7bc4b2)

You can create a ```Point2D``` object for a point with the specified x- and y-coordinates, use the ```distance``` method to compute the distance from this point to another point, and use the ```toString()``` method to return a string representation of the point

```TestPoint2D.java``` gives an example of using the class
