There are certain elements that are common to all programming languages.


Language Elements

All programming languages have some things in common. Table 1-2 lists the common elements you will find in almost every language.
```
Table 1-2
The common elements of a programming language
===========================================
Language Element	Description
===========================================
Keywords			||	These are words that have a special meaning in the programming language. They may be used for their intended purpose only. Keywords are also known as reserved words.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Operators			||	Operators are symbols or words that perform operations on one or more operands. An operand is usually an item of data, such as a number.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Punctuation			||	Most programming languages require the use of punctuation characters. These characters serve specific purposes, such as marking the beginning or ending of a statement, or separating items in a list.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Programmer-Defined Names	||	Unlike keywords, which are part of the programming language, these are words or names that are defined by the programmer. They are used to identify storage locations in memory and parts of the program that are created by the programmer. Programmer-defined names are often called identifiers. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax				||	These are rules that must be followed when writing a program. Syntax dictates how keywords and operators may be used, and where punctuation symbols must appear.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Let’s look at an example Java program and identify an instance of each of these elements. Code Listing 1-1 shows the code listing with each line numbered.


Code Listing 1-1 Payroll.java
```
public class Payroll 
{ 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
      int hours = 40; 
      double grossPay, payRate = 25.0; 
   
      grossPay = hours * payRate; 
      System.out.println("Your gross pay is $" + grossPay); 
    } 
} 
```

**NOTE**: The line numbers are not part of the program. They are included to help point out specific parts of the program.

Keywords (Reserved Words)
==========================
Two of Java’s keywords appear in line 1: ```public``` and ```class```. In line 3, the words ```public```, ```static```, and ```void``` are all keywords. The words int in line 5 and double in line 6 are also ­keywords. These words, which are always written in lowercase, each have a special meaning in Java and can only be used for their intended purpose. As you will see, the programmer is allowed to make up his or her own names for certain things in a program. Keywords, however, are reserved and cannot be used for anything other than their designated purpose. Part of learning a programming language is learning the commonly used keywords, what they mean, and how to use them.

```
The Java keywords
=======================
abstract	const		final		int		public		throw 
assert		continue	finally		interface	return		throws
boolean		default		float		long		short		transient
break		do		for		native		static		true
byte		double		goto		new		strictfp	try
case		else		if		null		super		void
catch		enum		implements	package		switch		volatile
char		extends 	import		private		synchronized	while
class﻿		false		instanceof	protected	this	
```

**Programmer-Defined Names**
The words hours, payRate, and grossPay that appear in the program in lines 5, 6, 8, and 9 are programmer-defined names. They are not part of the Java language but are names made up by the programmer. In this particular program, these are the names of variables. As you will learn later in this chapter, variables are the names of memory locations that may hold data.

**Operators**

In line 8 the following line appears:
```
grossPay = hours * payRate;
```
The = and * symbols are both operators. They perform operations on items of data, known as operands. The * operator multiplies its two operands, which in this example are the variables hours and payRate. The = symbol is called the assignment operator. It takes the value of the expression that appears at its right and stores it in the variable whose name appears at its left. In this example, the = operator stores in the grossPay variable the result of the hours variable multiplied by the payRate variable. In other words, the statement says, “the grossPay variable is assigned the value of hours times payRate.”

**Punctuation**

Notice that lines 5, 6, 8, and 9 end with a semicolon. A semicolon in Java is similar to a period in English: It marks the end of a complete sentence (or statement, as it is called in programming jargon). Semicolons do not appear at the end of every line in a Java program, however. There are rules that govern where semicolons are required and where they are not. Part of learning Java is learning where to place semicolons and other punctuation symbols.

Lines and Statements
====================
Often, the contents of a program are thought of in terms of lines and statements. A line is just that—a single line as it appears in the body of a program. Code Listing 1-1 is shown with each of its lines numbered. Most of the lines contain something meaningful; however, line 7 is empty. Blank lines are only used to make a program more readable.

A statement is a complete instruction that causes the computer to perform some action. Here is the statement that appears in line 9 of Code Listing 1-1:
```
System.out.println("Your gross pay is $" + grossPay);
```
This statement causes the computer to display a message on the screen. Statements can be a combination of keywords, operators, and programmer-defined names. Statements often occupy only one line in a program, but sometimes they are spread out over more than one line.

Variables
=========
The most fundamental way that a Java program stores an item of data in memory is with a variable. A variable is a named storage location in the computer’s memory. The data stored in a variable may change while the program is running (hence the name “variable”). Notice that in Code Listing 1-1 the programmer-defined names hours, payRate, and grossPay appear in several places. All three of these are the names of variables. The hours variable is used to store the number of hours the user has worked. The payRate variable stores the user’s hourly pay rate. The grossPay variable holds the result of hours multiplied by payRate, which is the user’s gross pay.

Variables are symbolic names made up by the programmer that represent locations in the computer’s RAM. When data is stored in a variable, it is actually stored in RAM. Assume that a program has a variable named length. Figure 1-4 illustrates the way the variable name represents a memory location.

In Figure 1-4, the variable length is holding the value 72. The number 72 is actually stored in RAM at address 23, but the name length symbolically represents this storage location. If it helps, you can think of a variable as a box that holds data. In Figure 1-4, the number 72 is stored in the box named length. Only one item may be stored in the box at any given time. If the program stores another value in the box, it will take the place of the number 72.

The Compiler and the Java Virtual Machine
=============================================
When a Java program is written, it must be typed into the computer and saved to a file. A text editor, which is similar to a word processing program, is used for this task. The Java programming statements written by the programmer are called source code, and the file they are saved in is called a source file. Java source files end with the .java extension.

After the programmer saves the source code to a file, he or she runs the Java compiler. A compiler is a program that translates source code into an executable form. During the translation process, the compiler uncovers any syntax errors that may be in the program. Syntax errors are mistakes that the programmer has made that violate the rules of the programming language. These errors must be corrected before the compiler can translate the source code. Once the program is free of syntax errors, the compiler creates another file that holds the translated instructions.

Most programming language compilers translate source code directly into files that contain machine language instructions. These are called executable files because they may be executed directly by the computer’s CPU. The Java compiler, however, translates a Java source file into a file that contains byte code instructions. Byte code instructions are not machine language, and therefore cannot be directly executed by the CPU. Instead, they are executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is a program that reads Java byte code instructions and executes them as they are read. For this reason, the JVM is often called an interpreter, and Java is often referred to as an interpreted language. Figure 1-5 illustrates the process of writing a Java program, compiling it to byte code, and running it.

Although Java byte code is not machine language for a CPU, it can be considered as machine language for the JVM. You can think of the JVM as a program that simulates a computer whose machine language is Java byte code.

**Portability**

The term portable means that a program may be written on one type of computer and then run on a wide variety of computers, with little or no modification necessary. Because Java byte code is the same on all computers, compiled Java programs are highly portable. In fact, a compiled Java program may be run on any computer that has a Java Virtual Machine. Figure 1-6 illustrates the concept of a compiled Java program running on Windows, Linux, Mac, and UNIX computers.

![FG_01_006](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d66f2cfe-b086-42ec-a54b-013048a59579)

With most other programming languages, portability is achieved by the creation of a compiler for each type of computer that the language is to run on. For example, in order for the  C++
  language to be supported by Windows, Linux, and Mac computers, a separate  C++
  compiler must be created for each of those environments. Compilers are very complex programs, and more difficult to develop than interpreters. For this reason, a JVM has been developed for many types of computers.

**Java Software Editions**

The software that you use to create Java programs is referred to as the JDK (Java Development Kit) or the SDK (Software Development Kit). There are the following different editions of the JDK available from Oracle:

- Java SE—The Java Standard Edition provides all the essential software tools necessary for writing Java applications.
- Java EE—The Java Enterprise Edition provides tools for creating large business applications that employ servers and provide services over the Web.
- Java ME—The Java Micro Edition provides a small, highly optimized runtime environment for consumer products such as cell phones, pagers, and appliances.

These editions of Java may be downloaded from Oracle by going to:
