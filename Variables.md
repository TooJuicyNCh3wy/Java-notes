# Variables
A Place holder for a value that behaves as the value it contains

remember back in the school days of algebra where it would only have variables for numbers? 

its like that

but 
now adding words, texts and this below is called boolean
- Boolean
  - values which hold either true or false
```
x = 12
y = "Andy"
z = True
```

 # Data Types
 ```
Data Type___Size___Primitive / Reference___value
*boolean   1 Bit   Primitive      True or false
byte       1 byte  Primitive      -128 to 127
short      2 bytes Primitive      -32,768 to 32,767
*int       4 bytes Primitive      -2 Billion to 2 Billion
long       8 bytes Primitive      -9 Quintillion to 9 Quintillion

float      4 bytes Primitive      Fractional number up to 6-7 Digits (3.141592f)
*double    8 bytes Primitive      Fractional number up to 15 Digits

*char      2 bytes Primitive      Single character/letter/ASCII Value (Ex. 'f')
*string    varies  Reference      A sequence of characters (ex. "Hello World!")
```
 There are 8 data types and a special reference data type called a string 
 the ones with the * are the more important ones
