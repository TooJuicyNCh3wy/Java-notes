Lets Start using arrays in java shall we?
```
public class ArrayExamples{
  public static void main(String[] args){

  }
}
```
remember the class name for this file is also the name of the file
so
public class ArrayExamples is also ArrayExamples.java

So in order to Make an Array you can make it any way possible
Either
  String
  Int
  Double
  Char
  Float
  etc etc

for this lesson we will be using (String)
