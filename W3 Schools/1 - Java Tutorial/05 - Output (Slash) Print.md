# Print Text
you learned from the last document that can use the ```println()``` method to output values or print text in Java:
```
System.out.println("Hello World");
```
You can add as many ```println()``` methods as you like :))

Note that it will add a new line with each method:
```
System.out.println("Hello World!");
System.out.println("I am learning Java.");
System.out.println("It is awesome!");
```
