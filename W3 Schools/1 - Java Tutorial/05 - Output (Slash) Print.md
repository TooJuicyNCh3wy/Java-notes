# Print Text
you learned from the last document that can use the ```println()``` method to output values or print text in Java:
```
System.out.println("Hello World");
```
You can add as many ```println()``` methods as you like :))

Note that it will add a new line with each method:
```
System.out.println("Hello World!");
System.out.println("I am learning Java.");
System.out.println("It is awesome!");
```
-----------------------------------------------------
# Double Quotes

Text must be wrapped inside the double quotation marks ""

If you target the double quotes, an error occurs
```
EXAMPLE
System.out.println("This Sentence will work);
-----------------
System.out.println(Sentence will produce an error);
```
------------------------------------------------------
# Print Method()

There is also a print method, Similar to ```printoln()```

THE ONLY DIIFERENCE??
- it doesnt insert a new line at the end of the output
```
Example
System.out.print("Hello World! ");
System.out.print("I will be on the same line when it starts running");
```
