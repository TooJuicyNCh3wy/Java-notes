# Print Numbers
You can also use ```println() method to print numbers.

However, 

Unlike text, we dont put numbers inside double quotes:
```
Example
System.out.println(3);
System.out.println(358);
System.out.println(50000);
```
You can also perform mathematical calculations inside the ```println()``` method
```
EXAMPLE
System.out.println(3 + 3);
System.out.print(2 * 5);
```
