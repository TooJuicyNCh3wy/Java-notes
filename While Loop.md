A loop is a control structure that causes a statement or group of statements to repeat. Java has three looping control structures: the while loop, the do-while loop, and the for loop. The difference among each of these is how they control the repetition.

The while loop has two important parts: 
- a boolean expression that is tested for a true or false value,
- a statement or block of statements that is repeated as long as the expression is true.
