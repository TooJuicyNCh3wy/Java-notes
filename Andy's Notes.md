# Chapter I - Intro to Computers, Programs & Java
Trust me no one needs to understand this unless like if you really wanna know heres a summary 

[W3 Schools](https://github.com/aalons012/Java-notes/blob/main/W3%20Schools/1%20-%20Java%20Tutorial/02%20-%20Intro.md)

-----------------------------
## I.I - Introduction
This section provides an overview of the chapter and sets the stage for understanding how computers and Java programming work together.

## I.II - What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device designed to process and store data. Computers include both hardware (the physical components you can touch) and software (the invisible programs that control the hardware).

Key components discussed include:
- Central Processing Unit (CPU): Known as the brain of the computer, it retrieves instructions from memory and executes them.
- Memory (RAM): Stores instructions and data for the CPU. It’s volatile, meaning data is lost when the computer is turned off.
- Storage Devices: Such as hard drives and USB flash drives, are non-volatile and hold data permanently until deleted.
- Input/Output Devices: Includes keyboards, mice, monitors, and printers, allowing users to interact with the computer.
## I.III - Programming Languages
Computers use programming languages to perform tasks. The chapter explains the types of programming languages:
- Machine Language: The computer's native binary language.
- Assembly Language: A low-level language that uses mnemonics instead of binary codes.
- High-Level Languages: These include Java, Python, and C++, which are more human-readable and must be translated into machine code by a compiler.
## I.IV - Operating Systems
The Operating System (OS) is the software that manages the hardware and other software on a computer. Examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux. Java programs can be run on any operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which provides Java's platform independence.
## I.V - Java, the World Wide Web, and Beyond
Java was originally designed to run on web browsers via applets, but due to security concerns, applets are no longer used. However, Java is now widely used for building web applications on servers, processing data, and generating dynamic web pages.
## I.VI - The Java Language Specifications, API, JDK, JRE, & IDE
Computer languages have strict rules of usage.

If you dint follow the rules when wrint a program,
- The computer will not be able to understand
  - These 2 Define JAVA Standards
    - Java Language Specification
      - From [Vocabulary](https://github.com/aalons012/Java-notes/blob/main/Andy's%20Notes.md#j)
        > 1. a Technical definition of the Java Programming
        > 2. It Describes all aspects of the language, including the semantics of all types, statements, and expression as well as threads and binary compatibility
    - Java API
      - Also Known As Library
      - Contains predefined classes and interfaces for developeing Java programs
      - Still Expanding
     
Java is a Full Fledged and powerful language that be used i many ways. 

It comes in 3 Editions
- SE
  - Standard Edition
    - To develop applications
    - The applications can run on Desktop.
- EE
  - Enterprise Edition
    - to develop server-side applications
      - Such as
        - Java servlets
        - JavaServer Pages (JSP)
        - JavaServer Faces (JSF)
- ME
  - Micro Edition
    - to develop applications for mobile devices

- [W3 Schools](https://github.com/aalons012/Java-notes/blob/main/W3%20Schools/1%20-%20Java%20Tutorial/03%20-%20Getting%20Started.md)

## I.VIII Creating, Compiling, and Executing a Java Program
Java programs are saved in .java files, compiled into .class files, and executed by the JVM. The process involves:
- Writing the program.
- Compiling it using the ```javac``` command.
- Running it using the ```java``` command.
  
## I.IX - Programming Style and Documentation
Good programming style is essential for readability and maintenance. It includes writing clear, concise code, using proper indentation, and documenting the code with comments. The chapter also introduces Javadoc comments, which can generate HTML documentation from code comments.

## I.X - Programming Errors
The chapter introduces three types of programming errors:
- Syntax Errors: Detected by the compiler, these occur when code doesn’t conform to the Java language rules.
- Runtime Errors: These happen during program execution and can cause the program to crash.
- Logic Errors: These are errors in the program’s logic that result in incorrect output, even if the program runs successfully.

# Chapter IX - Objects and Classes
## IX.I & II - Defining Classes for Objects
Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- essentially a technology for developing reusable software
- involves using obejcts

Object
- represents an entity to the real world that can be distinctly identified
  - These **Examples** can all be viewed as objects:
    - student
    - desk
    - circle
    - button
    - loan
- It has a unique identity, state and behavior

State of an Object
> AKA its properties or atrributes
- represented by data fields with current values
- EXAMPLE
  - A ```circle``` object
    - has a data field ```radius```
      - the property that characterize a circle
  - A ```rectangle``` object
    - has a data fields ```width``` and ```height```
      - which are the properties that characterize a rectangle
- consists of a set of **Data Fields** with their current values

Behavior of an object
> AKA its actions
- defined by a set of methods
- To invoke a method to an object
  - to ask the object to perform an action
 
An object has **both** a **state** and **behavior**. The state defines the object, and the behavior defines what the object does.

Objects of the same type are defined using a common class.
- A ```class``` is a...
  - template
  - blueprint
  - contract
 - ...that defines what an object's data fields and methods will be

An object is an **instance** of a class
- creating an instance is reffered to as **instantiation**

The terms _Object_ and _instance_ are often interchangeable

A Java class uses variables to define data fields and methods to define actions.
- a class provides methods of a special type, ...
  - known as constructors
- ...which are invokes to create a new object.

A Constructor can perform any action, but Constructors are designed to perform initializing actions **SUCH AS**
- initializing the data fields of objects
  - Look at ```class Circle``` from the source code image below ↓↓↓

Classes are constructs that define object of the same type

------------------------------------------------------
#### 9.2 - A Class is a template for creating objects
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3f9239f-7719-444f-9516-fe36a2b421d3)

------------------------------------------------------
#### 9.3 - A Class is a construct that defines objects of the same type
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f81a6fa4-b5d2-4407-a27e-84dbcf606d81)

------------------------------------------------------
The image right above... ↑↑↑

The ```Circle``` class is a bit different from all of the other classes you have seen thus far
- It doesnt have a ```main``` method
  - **THEREFORE**
    - cannot be run
      - its a definition for circle Objects

The class that contains the ```main``` method will be referred to in this notes, for convenience, as the main class

In 9.2
- The illustration of class templates and objects can be standardized using
  - is called **U**nified **M**odeling **L**anguage notation
    - **UML**
   
The image below (9.4) is called a UML class diagram
- or just call it a class diagram if youre a normal human being

In the class diagram
- the data field is denoted as:
```
dataFieldName: dataFieldType
```
- The constructor is denoted as:
```
ClassName(ParametherName: parameterType)
```
- The method is denoted as:
```
methodName(parameterName: parameterType): returnType
```
---------------------------------------
#### 9.4 - Classes and objects can be represented using UML notation

-------------------------------------------------------
## IX.III Example - Defining Classes and Creating Objects
This section gives 2 examples of defining classes and use the classes to create objects

##### Listing 9.1
Is a program that defines ```Circle``` and uses it to create objects.
- This program Constructs 3 circle objects **with radius**...
  - 1
  - 25
  - 125

...and displays the ```radius``` and ```area``` of each of the 3 circles.

and it will then change the radius of the 2nd radius and will display its new radius and area

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01d8b668-01c8-4c12-913f-c07239de29da) 

-------------------
Lets Break it down 

Line 1. ```public class TestCircle {}```
- Declares a public class named TestCircle.

Line 2. ```public static void main(String[] args)```
- Defines the main method, which is the entry point for any standalone Java application. It accepts an array of strings as arguments. without main...it willnot work

3-5. Creating and displaying area for a circle with radius 1:
- Line 4: A ```Circle``` object named ```circle1``` is created using the default constructor, which sets the radius to 1.
- Line 5: The area of ```circle1``` is calculated by calling getArea() and the result is printed.

7-9. Creating and displaying area for a circle with radius 25:

- Line 8: A ```Circle``` object named ```circle2``` is created using the constructor that accepts a double for radius, setting the radius to 25.
- Line 9: The area of ```circle2``` is calculated by calling ```getArea()``` and the result is printed.

11-13. Creating and displaying area for a circle with radius 125:
- Line 12: A ```Circle``` object named ```circle3``` is created with a radius of 125.
- Line 13: The area of ```circle3``` is calculated and printed.

15-17. Modifying the radius of circle2 and displaying the new area:
- Line 16: The radius of ```circle2``` is set to 100 using ```setRadius```.
- Line 17: The area of the modified ```circle2``` is calculated and printed.

21-23. Definition of the ```Circle``` class:
- Line 22: Declares a class named ```Circle```.
- Line 23: Defines a field ```radius``` of type double to store the radius of the circle.

25-29. Constructor for ```Circle``` with no arguments (default constructor):

- Line 26-28: Defines a constructor that does not take any arguments and sets the radius of any new ```Circle``` object to 1.

31-33. Constructor for ```Circle``` that specifies a radius:
- Line 32: Defines a constructor that accepts a ```double``` parameter and sets the ```radius``` of the ```Circle``` object to the passed value.

35-39. Method to return the area of the circle:
- Line 36-38: Defines ```getArea()```, a method that calculates and returns the area of the circle using the formula 𝜋𝑟<sup>2</sup>

41-45. Method to return the perimeter of the circle:
- Line 42-44: Defines ```getPerimeter()```, a method that calculates and returns the perimeter (circumference) of the circle using the formula 2𝜋𝑟

47-51. Method to set a new radius for the circle:
- Line 48-50: Defines ```setRadius(double newRadius)```, a method that sets the radius of the circle to a new value provided as an argument.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Chapter X - Object-oriented Thinking
## Introduction 
The preceding chapter introduced objects and classes. You learned how to define classes, create objects, and use objects. This book’s approach is to teach problem solving and fundamental programming techniques before object-oriented programming. This chapter shows how procedural and object-oriented programming differ. You will see the benefits of object-oriented 
programming and learn to use it effectively.

Our focus here is on **class design**. We will use several examples to illustrate the advantages of the object-oriented approach. The examples involve designing new classes and using them in applications and introducing new classes in the Java API.
## X.II - Class Abstraction and Encapsulation
The Creator of a class 
- **DESCRIBES** the Functions of the class
- lets the user know how the class is used

The collection of like
- Constructore
- methods
- fields
  - all these 3 that are accessible from outside the class
    -  **TOGETHER** with the description of how these members are **Expected** to behave...
      - Serves as the class contract
        - As Shown in 10.1 ↓↓↓↓

The Details of implementation are encapsulated and hidden from the user
- This is known as _class encapsulation_
  - Example
    - you can create a ```Circle```object and fine the data of the circle **WITHOUT** knowing how the area is computed
      - Because of this reason, A class is **ALSO KNOWN AS**
        - abstract data type (ADT)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
#### 10.1 - Class Abstraction seperated class implementation from the use of the class

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e737387-7260-48b9-b30b-b230f8a8bad9)

------------------------------------------------------
Class Abstraction and Encapsulation are two sides of the same coin. 

Many real-life examples illustrate the concept of Class Abstraction

Like building a Computer. It has many components
- CPU
- RAM
- SSD
- Motherboard
- Cooling Fan
- Exhaust Fans

Each component can be viewed as an object that has properties and methods. To get the components to work together
- need to know how **EACH component** is used and how it interacts with others
  - **YOU DONT NEED TO KNOW HOW THE COMPONENTS WORK INTERNALLY**

Internal implementation is encapsulated and hidden for you

The Computer-parts-building system analogy precisely mirrors the Object-Oriented approach
- Each component can be viewed as an object of the class for the component
  - EXAMPLE
    - might have a class that models all kinds of fans for the use of a computer
      - with properties such as fan size and speed and methods such as start and stop
      - A Specific fan is an instance of this class with specific property values
  - ANOTHER EXAMPLE
    - Getting a Loan
      - Specific loan that can be viewed as an object of a ```Loan``` class.
        - Interest Rate
        - Loan Amount
        - Loan Period
          - these 3 are its data properties
          - and
          - computing the monthly and total payments are its methods
    
---------------------------------------------------------
Listing 2.9, ComputeLoan.java, presented a program for computing loan payments. 

That program **cannot** be reused in other programs **because** the code for computing the payments is in the ```main``` method. 

One way to fix this problem is to **define static** methods for computing the monthly payment and the total payment. 

However, this solution has limitations. 
- Suppose that you wish to associate a date with the loan. There is no good way to tie a date with a loan without using objects. 

The traditional procedural programming paradigm is action-driven, and data are separated from actions. The object-oriented programming paradigm focuses on objects, and actions are defined along with the data in objects. To tie a date with a loan, you can define a loan class with a date along with the loan’s other properties as data fields. A loan object now contains data and actions for manipulating and processing data, and the loan data and actions are integrated in one object. 

↓↓↓ 10.2 shows the UML class diagram for the Loan class. ↓↓↓

------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### 10.2 - The ```Loan``` class models the properties and behaviors of loans
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/127e9ef8-dc6c-4e45-8e38-6d536b859209)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Above...
Serves as the contract for the ```Loan``` class

Rember that a class user can use the class without knowing how the class is implemented

Assume that the ```Loan``` class is available. The Program **Listing 10.1** uses that class.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### ```TestLoanClass.java```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b6c7f5b-c03e-42ad-adaa-ca491c822c0d)

--------------------
The ```main``` method ONLY reads the interest rate the payment period, in years, and the loan amount
- Thus Creating a ```Loan``` Object
- Which by then, obtains the monthly payment (Line 24)
- And the total Payment (Again 24)

if you press run it...doesnt run right?

**its because its missing the ```Loan``` Class**

its the main reason why it cant run at the moment, soo, its add it shall we??

----------------------------------------
### ```Loan.java```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/277668a2-631d-4463-8d3b-e1a1122cf6a8)

---------------------------------------------
Lets Break it Down

```
public class Loan {
```
it defines a public class named ```Loan```
```
private double annualInterestRate;
private int numberOfYears;
private double loan Amount
private java.util.Date loanDate;
```
First ```private```
- Private means that these fields **CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED BY ONLY THIS CLASS...NO ONE ELSE BUT** ```public class Loan```
- And these private variables that are exclusively to ```Loan```, are for the loan's annual interest rate, number of years, amount, and the date of when it has been locked and loaded
```
public Loan(){
  this(2.5,1,1000);
}
```
This is a no-arg constructor that makes the variables from ```Loan``` with default values
- 2.5 for default interest rate, for ```double```
- 1 for how many year(s), for ```int```
- 1000 for the default loan amount, for ```double``` only because if someone decides to add a decimal point on the loan amount

and by using ```this```, it refers to the current object, ```Loan```, in a method or constructor
```
  public Loan(double annualInterestRate, int numberOfYears, double loanAmount) {
    this.annualInterestRate = annualInterestRate;
    this.numberOfYears = numberOfYears;
    this.loanAmount = loanAmount;
    loanDate = new java.util.Date();
  }
```
this right here is the Main Constructor having the public with the class, being ```Loan``` with the parameters that are under ```TestLoanClass.java```, which will then initialize those parameters to initialize the corresponding fields. Also, sets ```loanDate``` to current date and time.
```
public double getAnnualInterestRate() {
    return annualInterestRate;
  }

  public void setAnnualInterestRate(double annualInterestRate) {
    this.annualInterestRate = annualInterestRate;
  }

  public int getNumberOfYears() {
    return numberOfYears;
  }

  public void setNumberOfYears(int numberOfYears){
    this.numberOfYears = numberOfYears;
  }

  public Double getLoanAmount() {
    return loanAmount;
  }

  public void setLoanAmount(double loanAmount){
    this.loanAmount = loanAmount;
  }
```
Provides getter and setter methods for each field, allowing controlled access and modification of these fields from outside the class. This encapsulation protects the integrity of the data.
```
public double getMonthlyPayment(){
    double monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate / 1200;
    double monthlyPayment = loanAmount * monthlyInterestRate / (1 - (1 / Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, numberOfYears * 12)));
    return monthlyPayment;
  }
```
Calculates the monthly payment using the formula for amortizing a loan based on the compound interest rate formula. The interest rate is divided by 1200 to convert from an annual percentage to a monthly fraction.
```
public double getTotalPayment() {
    double totalPayment = getMonthlyPayment() * numberOfYears * 12;
    return totalPayment;
  }
```
Computes the total payment over the life of the loan by multiplying the monthly payment by the total number of payments (12 months times the number of years).
```
  public java.util.Date getLoanDate() {
    return loanDate;
  }
```
Provides a method to retrieve the date when the loan was created.
This class is a typical example of a well-encapsulated Java class that defines a specific business entity, in this case, a loan. It uses private fields to protect its data and public methods to provide controlled access and functionality based on that data.

-------------------------
And after all this 

FINALLY

you can now run it

lets run it shall we

for this example well use the following
- 3 for interest rate
- 3 for years
- 20,000 for the amount

this is the result
```
Enter your annual interest rate: 3
Enter the number of years AS A WHOLE NUMBER (Integer): 3
How much would you like for the loan:20000
The loan was created on Wed Oct 02 14:39:09 EDT 2024
The monthly payment is 581.62
The total payment is 20938.47
```
WOOOOWWWWW

-----------------------------------
now
from a class developer's perspective
- a class is designed for use by many different customers

In order to make a class useful in a wide range of applications
- it should provide a variety of ways for customization through...
  - constructors
  - properties
  - methods

The ```loan``` class contains 2 constructors
- 4 getters
- 3 setters
- The methods for finding the monthly payment and the total payment

-------------------------------------------------
#### Important Pedagogical Tip
Use the UML diagram for the Loan class shown in **10.2** to write a test program that uses the ```Loan``` class even though you don’t know how the ```Loan``` class is implemented. This has three benefits:
- It demonstrates that developing a class and using a class are two separate tasks.
- It enables you to skip the complex implementation of certain classes without interrupting the sequence of this book.
- It is easier to learn how to implement a class if you are familiar with it by using the class.

For all the class examples from now on, create an object from the class and try using its methods before turning your attention to its implementation

----------------------------------
## X.III - Thinking in Objects
Chapter's I - VIII were apparently showing them the techniques for using loops, methods and arrays

Knowing these 3...
- lays a solid foundation for OOP

Classes provide more flexibility and modularity for building reusable software. 

In chapter III.IV there was a program for computing the body mass index (BMI) called ```ComputeAndInterperetBMI.java```
[click here](https://github.com/aalons012/Java-notes/blob/main/COP_2800_and_2805C/Source%20Codes/2805C%20-%20Java%20II/Chapter%20III%20Source%20Codes/ComputeAndInterpretBMI.java)

when you see how its been formated it is only on the ```main``` method
- meaning that it cannot be reused in other programs

Lets change that :))

To make it reusable,
- define a static method to compiute BMI as follows
```
public static void double getBMI(double weight, double height)
```
This is useful for computing the BMI for a specified weight and height but has limitations
> Suppose you need to associate the weight and height with a person’s name and birth date. You could declare separate variables to store these values, but these values would not be tightly coupled.

The Ideal way to couple them is...
- creating an object that contains them all.

Since they are tied to individual objects, they should be stored instance data fields
- you can define a class named ```BMI``` as shown in 10.3

------------------------------------------------------------------
10.3 - The ```BMI``` class encapsulates BMI information
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/413958f4-8830-45b6-905e-73a67a3510e5)

-------------------------
Assume that the ```BMI``` class is available. ```UseBMIClass.java``` gives a test program that uses this class

-------
## ```UseBMIClass.java```
