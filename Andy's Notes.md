# Chapter I - Intro to Computers, Programs & Java
## I.I - Intro
What is Programming?
- Programming
  - To create/develop software
    - Also called Program
  - In basic terms,
    - Software contains instructions that tell a computer–or a computerized device–what to do.

Software
- Its all around you
- Ofc you expect to find and use software on a personal computer
- It also plays a role in running
  - Airplanes
  - Cars
  - Cell phones
    - Android Specifically
  - EVEN TOASTERS

  - Web browsers
    - To explore the internet
  - Email Programs
    - To send and receive messages

## I.VI - The Java Language Specifications, API, JDK, JRE, & IDE
Computer languages have strict rules of usage.

If you dint follow the rules when wrint a program,
- The computer will not be able to understand
  - These 2 Define JAVA Standards
